bq27441 battery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties :
 - compatible : Should contain "ti,bq27441".
 - ti,tz-name : Thermal zone name.
Optional properties :
 - ti,design-capacity : The designed battery capacity used for
   gauge's predictions. in mAh.
 - ti,design-energy : The designed battery energy. in mWh.
 - ti,taper-rate : The current threshold below which your charger
   IC is set to stop charging once it considers the battery to be
   full. in mA.
 - ti,terminate-voltage : Should be set to the minimum operating
   voltage of your system. This is the target where the gauge
   typically reports 0% capacity. in mV.
 - ti,v-at-chg-term : Voltage at charge termination. in mV.
 - ti,kernel-threshold-soc: Minimum SoC for kernel read from device.
        Bootloader jumps to kernel when SoC is more than this value.
        Driver make this SoC as 0% before reporting it to the framework.
 - ti,kernel-maximum-soc: Maximum SoC for kernel read from device.
        Kernel read maximum SoC from device for given battery. Kernel
        translate the SoC to 100% before reporting to framework if it
        reads equal/more than this value.
 - ti,enable-temp-prop:should enable temp prop if platform supports
        battery temp reading through fuel gauge chip or ADC channel.
Example:

	bq27441@55 {
		compatible = "ti,bq27441";
		ti,design-capacity = <7800>;
		ti,design-energy = <28314>;
		ti,taper-rate = <167>;
		ti,terminate-voltage = <3150>;
		ti,v-at-chg-term = <4200>;
		ti,tz-name = "battery-temp";
		ti,kernel-threshold-soc = <5>;
		ti,kernel-maximum-soc = <99>;
	};
