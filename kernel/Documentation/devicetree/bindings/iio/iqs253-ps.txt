* IQS253 proximity sensor

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "azoteq,iqs2x3"
- reg: i2c address of the device. It is one of 0x44-0x47.
- gpio_rdy: gpio to be used for i2c handshake with the sensor.

Optional properties:
- SAR_proximity_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the
                         SAR proximity.
- touch_proximity_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the
                           touch sensor.
  Note: To disable the entire device so that the driver unloads, all sensors
        must be disabled:
	SAR_proximity_disable = <1>;
	touch_proximity_disable = <1>;
- gpio_sar: gpio to be used for sending proximity event to SAR sensor.

Example:

	iqs263@44 {
		compatible = "azoteq,iqs263";
		reg = <0x44>;
		gpio_rdy = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(A, 1) GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		gpio_sar = <&gpio TEGRA_GPIO(V, 5) GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
