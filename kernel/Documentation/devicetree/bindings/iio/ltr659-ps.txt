* LTR659 proximity sensor

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "liteon,ltrX5X"
- reg: i2c address of the device. It is 0x23.
- vdd-supply: regulator supply for chip
- vled-supply: regulator supply for led anode.

Optional properties:
- light_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the light sensor.
- proximity_disable: Setting this property to <1> will disable the proximity
                     sensor.
  Note: If the device supports both light and proximity, then to disable the
        entire device so that the driver unloads, all sensors must be disabled:
	light_disable = <1>;
	proximity_disable = <1>;

Example:

	ltr659@23 {
		compatible = "liteon,ltrX5X";
		reg = <0x23>;
		vdd-supply = <&palmas_smps9>;
		vled-supply = <&palmas_smps8>;
	};
