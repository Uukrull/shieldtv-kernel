	help
		Say Y or M here if you want support for SoC audio on Tegra, using the
		virtual driver that exposes to user-space the full routing capabilities
		of the AHUB (Audio HUB) hardware module. Audio routing is modified with
		the help of amixer utility, provided by ALSA, from user-space.

	help
		Say Y or M here if the module depends upon tegra124 or later SoC.
		Virtual driver needs this as the driver support is available only
		for T124 or later SoC. For this option to work, all the dependencies
		should be selected in defconfig file.

	help
		Say Y or M if you want to add support for Tegra124 APBIF slave module.
		APBIF_SLAVE module exposes only apbif dai links to apbdma. This module
		can be build independent of APBIF_MASTER module. This module provides
		a pcm interface to slave card in audio virtualization use case.
